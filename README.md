# Theory and Application of Gaussian Processes for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
## Peter Tonner, Duke University

Gaussian proccesses (GPs) are a non-parameteric model of functional data that have wide applicability in many domains. 
The purpose of this workshop is to give a working knowledge of Gaussian processes, covering the basics of theory and practical examples of application, with a focus on how GPs can be used in computational biology research. After completing the workshop, participants should:
* Have a strong foundation in the theory of Gaussian processes sufficient to (i) continue exploring theory and (ii) understand novel GP research as it is published
* Know how to apply the most common Gaussian process analysis techniques to data through the python library \textit{GPy} \cite{gpy_gpy:_2012}
* Understand how to extend the basic GP functionality in \textit{GPy} in order to implement models in the Gaussian process literature or for their own research 
The workshop will provide this training through a series of sessions that build on previous lessons, and for this reason it is recommended to attend all sessions.
