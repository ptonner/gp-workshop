# Gaussian Processes for Computational Biology
## Peter Tonner, Duke University

Gaussian processes (GPs) are a non-parameteric model of functional data (e.g. time-course) that
have wide applicability in computational biology (see examples below). The purpose of this workshop is
to give a working knowledge of Gaussian processes, covering the basics of theory and practical
examples of application, with a focus on how GPs can be used in computational biology research.
